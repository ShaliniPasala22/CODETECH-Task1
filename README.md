# Wildlife Dataset Analysis

This project demonstrates an exploratory data analysis (EDA) process on a wildlife dataset using Python. The dataset contains detailed information about various animal species, including their physical characteristics, habitat, and conservation status. 

## Features in the Dataset
The dataset comprises the following columns:

1. *Name*: Name of the animal.
2. *Height (cm)*: Average height of the animal in centimeters.
3. *Weight (kg)*: Average weight of the animal in kilograms.
4. *Color*: Prominent color of the animal's body.
5. *Lifespan (years)*: Average lifespan in years.
6. *Diet*: The diet category (e.g., Carnivore, Herbivore).
7. *Habitat*: The habitat type.
8. *Predators*: Known predators of the species.
9. *Average Speed (km/h)*: Average speed in kilometers per hour.
10. *Countries Found*: Regions or countries where the species is commonly found.
11. *Conservation Status*: The IUCN conservation status (e.g., Endangered, Vulnerable).
12. *Family*: Taxonomic family of the animal.
13. *Gestation Period (days)*: Average gestation period in days.
14. *Top Speed (km/h)*: Maximum speed the species can achieve.
15. *Social Structure*: Social behavior (e.g., Solitary, Herd).
16. *Offspring per Birth*: Average number of offspring per birth.

## Project Highlights
The project includes:
- Data overview with key metrics (shape, info, missing values, statistical summary).
- Univariate analysis using histograms for numerical columns.

## Prerequisites
The following libraries are required to run the code:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Install these libraries using pip if not already installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
