Wildlife Dataset Analysis
This project demonstrates an exploratory data analysis (EDA) process on a wildlife dataset using Python. The dataset contains detailed information about various animal species, including their physical characteristics, habitat, and conservation status.

Features in the Dataset
The dataset comprises the following columns:

Name: Name of the animal.
Height (cm): Average height of the animal in centimeters.
Weight (kg): Average weight of the animal in kilograms.
Color: Prominent color of the animal's body.
Lifespan (years): Average lifespan in years.
Diet: The diet category (e.g., Carnivore, Herbivore).
Habitat: The habitat type.
Predators: Known predators of the species.
Average Speed (km/h): Average speed in kilometers per hour.
Countries Found: Regions or countries where the species is commonly found.
Conservation Status: The IUCN conservation status (e.g., Endangered, Vulnerable).
Family: Taxonomic family of the animal.
Gestation Period (days): Average gestation period in days.
Top Speed (km/h): Maximum speed the species can achieve.
Social Structure: Social behavior (e.g., Solitary, Herd).
Offspring per Birth: Average number of offspring per birth.
Project Highlights
The project includes:

Data overview with key metrics (shape, info, missing values, statistical summary).
Univariate analysis using histograms for numerical columns.
